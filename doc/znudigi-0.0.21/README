znudigi is a digital modem program for amateur (ham) radio.

Unlike other digimode programs, znudigi has a complete separation between
the receiver/modem code and the user interface code.  In fact, znudigi
is provided with no user interface, only a TCP/IP network interface
and a Java interface.

See the RPSK program for a sample network client in Java.

znudigi is designed to provide an easy path for experimentation in both 
digital signal processing design and in user interface design, by isolating
the two from one another.

To Compile:
- znudigi requires JDK 1.6 to compile.
- compile with build.sh or build.bat.

To Run:
Even if your computer has only one sound card, there will be multiple Java sound devices.
znudigi will try them all until it finds one that works.
If your computer has multiple sound cards, you may find that znudigi uses a sound
card other than the one you want.  If that happens, you can manually specify the
device number on the command line.

- Start with 
 java -jar znudigi.jar
to try sound all sound devices starting at 0.  It should stop at one that works.

You can note the number it prints out for the sound device and use it next time:
  java -jar znudigi.jar 4
