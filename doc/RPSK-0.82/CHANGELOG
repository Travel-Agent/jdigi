0.1 First Release 2003 March 16
0.2 Spectrum length is now x rather than x/2.
0.3 Cleanup layout.  Add more buttons; some of them work.
    There is a timing bug in the AWT layout; sometimes
    the waterfall comes up all the way on the left.
0.4 Made set mode work (bidirectional).
    Added bandwidth command (bidirectional).
0.5 Send characters; make TX/RX/Abort work.  Make SQL/AFC/LSB work.
    No sync up of button state yet.
0.6 Callsign and password authentication, though not hashed or encrypted
0.61 Echo of TX characters as sent.  TX buffer still not used properly.
0.62 Add frequency scale code copied from gMFSK with permission to use under MIT/X11 license
     from Tomi Manninen <oh2bns@sral.fi>.
0.7  Two changes to reduce JVM CPU usage from 99% to 3%:
     Fix busy loop in TX code (this accounts for most of the time).
     Use Java2D BufferedImage for offscreen image so that we can read directly from
     network stream without having to render pixels one at at time.  This change
     I may have to back out if it turns out there is more utility in having
     pre-JDK1.2 support.  
0.71 Back out BufferedImage code as changing the buffer to gray
     broke the green line and drawing it on the screen after the image 
     makes it flash.
     Try to make closing both application and applet work.
0.72 Hardcode 14.069 and LSB
     Try to show MHz in displays
0.73 Cut down on random digits in MHz

0.82 January 15, 2008 
     Improved command line args
     Handle both byte and nybbles for spectrum, with request set by command line.
     Default applet to nybbles.
